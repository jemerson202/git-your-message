4. Answer to Interview question (8/4/17):

A closure is an inner function that is able to access a function's outer variables. It has access to its own (local) functionality, the outside function's variables, and any variables declared globally. It's performing multiple tasks at the same time, so to speak. It's helpful because you can change the value of any global variables and the function will adjust accordingly. You could also change something within the outer function or the local variable and would see the updated values being returned by your function. It would also be helpful if you were using the same function across multiple pages because you could just update any values that you needed to and it would be applied to the function across all of the pages. You can change the script. But if you didn't have access to the global variables you wouldn't be able to do this, so that's where a closure would come in handy.
