4. Answer to Interview question (8/4/17):

A closure is an inner function that is able to access a function's outer variables. It has access to its own (local) functionality, the outside function's variables, and any variables declared globally. It's performing multiple tasks at the same time, so to speak. It's helpful because you can change the value of any global variables and the function will adjust accordingly. You could also change something within the outer function or the local variable and would see the updated values being returned by your function. It would also be helpful if you were using the same function across multiple pages because you could just update any values that you needed to and it would be applied to the function across all of the pages. You can change the script. But if you didn't have access to the global variables you wouldn't be able to do this, so that's where a closure would come in handy.

5. Answer to Interview question (8/9/17):

I am most familiar with using Git as a version control system. A version control is a system that records changes to files or changes to a set of files over time. It makes it easy to recall certain versions or revert back to a certain version of the files. Another version control system is Mercurial.

Git vs. Mercurial:
Pros of Git:
- Easy to revert back to a previous version of a project
- There are lots of commands so you can do a lot with it
- More for creating your own version-controlled workflow processes more than anything else
- Flexibility
- Good to use when sharing files with multiple people
Cons:
- Some people might think it's needlessly complicated
- Documentation is not great
Pros of Mercurial:
- Not as complex so some developers might appreciate that - installs 1 binary contrasted to the 144 that git installs
- Merging and branching are easily learned and intuitive
- Well documented
- Better to use if you're not sharing files with anyone
Cons:
- Deleting branches is incredibly difficult
- works more slowly than git and is inconsistent
