# Testing

This is a completely stripped down react app with a very simple passing test suite.

If you haven't read the documentation in the `creat-react-app` README that is very sad, but perhaps inevitable.  When you use this script to create a react app you can then run your tests with `npm test`.  Npm test runs all your tests whether in a `__test__` folder or with `test` in the file name.
